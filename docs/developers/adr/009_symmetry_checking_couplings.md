Symmetry Checking Couplings
===========================


Background
----------

The Hamiltonian use in linear spinwave theory can be thought of in two formally equivalent ways, 
one where we primarily sum over all couplings

$H = \sum_{k=1}^{n_\text{couplings}} s_{i(k)} C_k s_{j(k)} $

and one where the couplings for each pair of sites is lumped together, and we sum over (ordered) pairs of sites

$H = \sum_{i =1}^{n_\text{sites}}\sum_{j =1}^{i} s_i \left(\sum_{C\in\text{couplings(i,j)}} C\right) s_j 
= \sum_{i=1}^{n_\text{sites}}\sum_{j=1}^{i} s_i M_{ij} s_j $

The second of these is important as it shows that
