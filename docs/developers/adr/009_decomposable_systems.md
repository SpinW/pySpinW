Decomposable Systems
====================

A decomposable system is one where the couplings are such that the set of sites can be split into multiple sets where there are no couplings between them.


Formally
--------

If $S$ is the set of sites, and $C$ is a set of pairings representing the couplings ($C \subseteq S \times S$). Then a decomposable system is one for which
there are disjoint subsets of $S$, $S_1$ and $S_2$ (with $S_1 \cap S_2 = \emptyset$) such that $S_1 \cup S_2 = S$ and for which the set of couplings
$C$ only contains pairs from either $S_1 \times S_1$ or $S_2\times S_2$. Or in other words

$C \cap ((S_1 \times S_2) \cup (S_2 \times S_1)) = \emptyset$
