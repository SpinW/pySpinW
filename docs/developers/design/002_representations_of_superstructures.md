Representation of Superstructures
=================================

There are a number of different ways we can represent magnetic structures exist at a scale beyond the unit cell.

Firstly, we can distinguish between commensurate and incommensurate structures, i.e. those that have a period that
matches up with (can be fully represented with an integer multiple of) the lattice spacing, and those that are not.

Secondly, there is a question of how we represent the moment, for which there are two obvious approaches. 
The first of these two approaches is the usual way of representing them in the literature, where we write
a given moment $$m$$ as a sum

$$m = Re\{ \sum_i phi_i \exp(2\pi i k \dot r) \} $$

$$m = \sum_i phi_i \cos(2\pi k \dot r)$$
