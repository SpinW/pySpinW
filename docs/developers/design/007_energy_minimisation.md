# Classical Energy Minimisation

## Problem

We will think of the Hamiltonian in form, which is defined in terms of the mathematical form, not the physical meaning.
There are mixed bilinear terms (B), quadratic terms (A), and linear terms (C).
From a physical perspective, the bilinear terms are couplings between different sites, the quadratic terms
are self-couplings (i.e. same site, but maybe different cell) and anisotropies, and the
linear terms describe the effect of the magnetic field.

$H = \sum_{i \neq j} A_{ij} S_i^T S_j + \sum_i S_i^T B_i S_i + \sum_i S_i \cdot C_i $
